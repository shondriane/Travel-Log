  <h1>About</h1>
  <p> 
   One of my greatest loves, is to travel. Why? <br></br>
    It allows me to learn more about society and how interconnected we are.
    It gives me the space to grow and shift within myself.
    With this comes diversity in thought, pespective, kindness, love, and stepping out of my comfort zone.

   <h1> Unsolicited Advice </h1> 
<p>

    Someone once told me to travel the world while you can.<br></br> 
    Don't wait because tomorrow is never promised, and circmstances may change. 
   
    This made me think of my grandfather, who moved to his favorite city once he retired.
    Shortly thereafter, he got real sick and never had a chance to enjoy it. 
    So I pass on what was told to me. Go out there and see the world!
    Explore your own neighborhood, your own state, your own country, and different regions in the world. <br></br>
    You'll be suprised at what and who you'll find along the way.
