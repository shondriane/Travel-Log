  <h1>About</h1>
  <p> 
   One of my greatest loves, is to travel. Why? <br></br>
    It allows me to learn more about society and how interconnected we are and it gives me the space to relax, grow and shift within myself.
    With this comes diversity in thought, pespective, kindness, love, and stepping out of my comfort zone.
