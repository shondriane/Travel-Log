    One of my greatest loves, is to travel. Why? <br></br>
    It allows me to learn more about society and how interconnected we are.
    It gives me the space to grow and shift within myself.<br></br>
    With this comes diversity in thought, pespective, kindness, love, and stepping out of my comfort zone.<br></br>

    Someone once told me to travel the world, while you can. Don't wait because tomorrow is never promised, and circmstances may change. 
    <br></br>
    This made me think of my grandfather, who moved to his favorite city once he retired.
    Shortly thereafter, he got real sick and never had a chance to enjoy it. <br></br>
    So I pass on what was told to me, go out there and see the world.
    Explore your own neighborhood, your own state, your own country, and different regions in the world. <br></br>
    You'll be suprised at what you will find and learn.
